While I'd love to keep this reference repo fresh and updated, life gets in the way and also I don't have a firehose from all of these sources to know when they secretly change things. That's where you come in! If you see something that's out of date, or wrong, or you'd like to add some reference copy; by all means please do!

For most instances just create an [Issue] on this repo. **Please include the old info you're modifying, the new info, and the source to verify**. If you're savvy with markdown, feel free to make a [Pull Request]. If you're lazy, just [tweet me] and lmk what needs to be fixed.

I will certainly try to review and act on any requests as soon as I can; I want to make sure this reference guide remains accurate.

Thank you for your help!
